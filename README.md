# COVID19 DATA VISUALISER


At the start of 2020, the word was hit by the COVID19 virus, which changed the world as we know it. In this project, I used open-sourced static data to visualize the impact of the virus from January - December 2020. The visuals can be interacted with through the side bar on the left of the page. 


A couple of interesting findings from the analysis: ‍

By the end of 2020, United States and India had the highest volume of new COVID19 cases. We can see that US was the first country to experience large spike in daily cases. Within the year 2020, the country had experienced 2 waves of the virus. India experienced their first big wave of the virus in the year 2020 as well. Death rates from infections in most countries range between 1-4%. However, we see an anomaly in Yemen, where 29% of infected individuals had died from the virus. This is an indication of poorer healthcare standards and likely under-reporting of cases. As the virus started to pick up, countries started to warn of borders closures. search terms for travelling spiked from February, reaching a 3-year record high in mid-march before search terms too a drastic drop. For the rest of the year, search on travel remained at record lows. ‍‍

Some key concepts covered through this project include: 

1) Data Visualization 
2) HTML DOM 
3) Constructor Functions
4) Nested LoopingAn interesting feature of this project was the ability to download the visuals once they have been modified by the user.
